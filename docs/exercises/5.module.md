    Tip:  
    use console.log('your string');  
    or  console.log(yourVariable);

1. Create a _Counter_ factory with:
    * A private __value_ property initiated with 0.
    * A public _getValue_ method.

    Initialize and assign it to a variable and make a call to getValue from outside printing the counter value;

2. Add to _Counter_:
    * A private __changeValueBy_ method to change it's value.
    * A public _increment_ method that calls __changeValueBy_;
    * A public _decrement_ method that calls __changeValueBy_;

    Initialize two counters and make subsequent calls to increment and decrement then compare values of each counter instance;
