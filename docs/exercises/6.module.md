    Tip:  
    use console.log('your string');  
    or  console.log(yourVariable);

1. Create a function that throw a generic Error and call it.

2. Now, add a try/catch statement to handle this error.

3. Create 3 new functions named as below. Each function must print messages as specified.
    * _genericErrorHandler_ => "Generic Error handled"
    * _typeErrorHandler_ => "Type Error handled"
    * _referenceErrorHandler_ => "Reference Error handled"

    Change the first function, to throw one error type (TypeError, Error, ReferenceError and a CustomError) at a time and handle this errors with the functions created in the previous task.
    > Note: make sure that the first error thrown does not prevent the others to be thrown.
